This is an XML schema for freeIPE. This is also the first file of the freeIPE project to be released.
It may happen that XML is not the way to go for this project. Maybe it would change to SQLite.
Maybe both would be needed. At any rate I'm tired of reading books and I'm ready to start something
tangible. Please don't expect anything of useable quality here. I'm simply planning and intend to
build by iterating.

The tools that will be implemented in freeIPE will have an element declaration made globally that
may reference previously-defined global elements.

The aim here is to keep the tools and the data integrated.

E.G.: If you want to start the time tracker you have the option of tracking time for a task, or a project,
or a context, etc. If you want to mark your calendar with an appointment you could use these same
options. A future mind map plugin could use a goal or a project as the center, while child nodes
protruding from the center could represent subprojects or tasks.

Users are also global.

TODO:
The next version of this XSD file will inlcude an attempt to automate the various philosophies regarding productivity.
